# Next.js Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your Next.js 14.1.0 application was throwing this error:
```
Error: > Couldn't find any `pages` or `app` directory. Please create one under the project root
```

## Root Cause
Next.js requires either a `pages` directory (for the Pages Router) or an `app` directory (for the App Router, which is the default in Next.js 14). Your repository was missing both directories.

## Solution Implemented
I've successfully added the required `app` directory structure with the following files:

### Files Added to GitHub Repository

1. **app/page.tsx** - Main homepage component
   - Welcome message for AI Voice Tutor
   - Project description
   - Basic layout structure

2. **app/layout.tsx** - Root layout component
   - HTML structure
   - Metadata configuration
   - Global CSS import

3. **app/globals.css** - Global styles
   - Tailwind CSS directives
   - CSS custom properties
   - Base styling

4. **postcss.config.js** - PostCSS configuration
   - Tailwind CSS plugin
   - Autoprefixer plugin

## Verification
You can verify the fix was successful by visiting your repository:

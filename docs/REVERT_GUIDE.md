# Revert Guide: Return to Stable Version

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Revert the codebase to commit `e4a925065713152decfc746fca8f7ae65d0270ce` (October 24, 2025) which was the last known stable version before streaming optimizations were added.

## ðŸ“‹ What Happened

After commit `e4a92506`, several streaming optimization features were added:

1. **eef50aef** - Claude streaming support  
2. **fa976846** - TTS streaming and sentence chunking
3. **4e0d7162** - Streaming API endpoint implementation
4. **13285e12** - Frontend streaming with audio queue manager
5. **Multiple fixes** - TypeScript errors and debugging attempts

These changes, while aimed at improving latency, may have introduced instability.
